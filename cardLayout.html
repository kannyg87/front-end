        <h1>The Banana Bird</h1>
        <p>
            This banana looks a lot like a brid, doesn't it? When originally posted there was some debate whether it was a humminbird, a seagull, or a crow. I stand by my earlier statment that it is a banana.

            One of the kay engrediants of boller is cardamom - sothing that gives them a distinct aroma and gives them the more lengthy name "cardamom boller".

        <h1>A Dinosaur and its Jacket</h1>
        <p>
            They say dinosaurs had feathers. I prefer to think they were a bit more stylish that that, as proven by this dinosaur wearing a swanky aluminium coat.

        <p>
            Oh yes: Sometimes when you bake boller, you put a piece of chocolate ( usually dark) in the center before baking.<br>
            that way when an unsuspecting recipient bites into the backed deliciousness they get a sweet surprise.

                The Whiskey Jack is a surprisingly large bird that likes to eat food held up by tourists. In spite of what the images suggestes, it does in fact have wings.

            <p>
                On a recent trip to Europe my brother and I invented a new game called " pool cue pool-cue-jenga". It is the best game ever invented.<br>
                The rules are simple: you must use a pool cue to remove  tiles. Only one cue can be used , and can not use your finger.
